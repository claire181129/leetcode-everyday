about algorithm question:

1. case study, manually compute the example case, see how you get the result.
2. case coverage, what situation is covered in your code? What is not? From first line of code, record case in comment, write debug output for this case
3. debug code should be easily distinguishable between each case. with g++, #ifdef DEBUG, compile with -DDEBUG, or -D anything, #ifdef anything.
4. write a code(whatever it is, a mess or pass code), and test it, get the result
5. if not pass, code trace, till pass
6. Try to come up with a variety of problem-solving methods
7. Try to come up with an elegant algorithm
8. There's no target, you're just talking, say what you want, say what appear in your head.
9. Limit , quit
10. Theory vs practice, reality is ugly, but it's alive and playable, and can live better.
11. code block completity, code should be in block, should be tested as block, should be block complete(what's input, what's output).
12. code that's not elegant, not short, not clear, not block complete, is not code, it's trash. like HJ67.
13. If you're sure you're doing it wrong way, and you already got bad feeling, you should quit, take a break.
14. the nested if/while/loop, shouldn't be more than 3.
15. function, code block shouldn't be more than 30 lines.
